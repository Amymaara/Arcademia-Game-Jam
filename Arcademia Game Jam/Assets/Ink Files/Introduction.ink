The God's gave Pandora a single rule.

Do NOT open the box.

Unfortunately for the God's...

Pandora does not do well with instructions.

The moment the lid lifted, catastrophe was released into the world.

Pride. Famine. Death.

And a plethora of other atrocities.

#bg

Pandora tried to close the box.

But it was too late...

Everything had already escaped.

#bg

...Everything?

No, one remained.
